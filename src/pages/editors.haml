    Various text editors have different levels of support for Haml. Here's a list of all known packages &mdash; if you create or learn of a more updated version, please email [haml@googlegroups.com](mailto:haml@googlegroups.com).

    Haml's syntax is updated from time to time, meaning some of these modes might not be as current as possible. If anyone wants to take on the task of updating an old mode, that would be greatly appreciated.

    * **[Coda/SubEthaEdit](http://github.com/gf3/haml.mode)** by [Gianni Chiappetta](http://www.gf3.ca/).

    * **[Eclipse](http://haml.googlegroups.com/web/net.lucky_dip.hamleditor_site_0.5.4.zip)** by [Brad Wilson](http://lucky-dip.net/). This is a snapshot of the site that used to host the plugin, so it may be a bit confusing to get it working. The [EclipseColorer plugin](http://colorer.sourceforge.net/eclipsecolorer/) by [Igor Russkih](http://cail.nm.ru/) also has support for coloring Haml and Sass.

    * **[Emacs](http://github.com/nex3/haml-mode/tree/master/haml-mode.el)** by [Natalie Weizenbaum](http://nex-3.com). Probably the most up-to-date mode, since it's maintained by the former maintainer of Haml.

    * **[GEdit/Gnome](http://blog.ardekantur.com/2008/03/haml-syntax-highlighting-for-gedit/)** by [Ardenkatur](http://ardekantur.com/). There's also an [older package](http://groups.google.com/group/haml/msg/b5100d80d9182c71) by [Ivan Kerin](http://www.facebook.com/ivan.kn).

    * **[JEdit](http://blog.wolfman.com/articles/2006/12/01/a-haml-edit-mode-for-jedit)** by [Jim Morris](http://blog.wolfman.com/).

    * **[Kate/KDE](http://haml.googlegroups.com/web/haml_highlighting_for_kde.tar.gz)** by [Cies Breijs](http://ciesbreijs.blogspot.com).

    * **[Komodo](http://community.activestate.com/files/haml_bundle-0.1.1_0.zip)** (author unknown).

    * **[NetBeans](http://mediacast.sun.com/users/tnorbye/media/org-netbeans-modules-haml.nbm/details)** (author unknown).

    * **[RadRails](http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails)**: built-in.

    * **[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby)**: built-in.

    * **[TextMate/E Text Editor](http://github.com/handcrafted/handcrafted-haml-textmate-bundle)** by [Adam Stacoviak](http://www.adamstacoviak.com). There's also an [official](http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Ruby%20Haml.tmbundle) but out-of-date bundle by [Kevin Ballard](http://kevin.sb.org), and many [GitHub forks](http://github.com/douglasjarquin/ruby-haml-tmbundle/network) of that bundle.

    * **[Vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-haml)** by [Tim Pope](http://www.stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com). There's also an [official](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1773) but out-of-date mode by [Dmitry Ilyashevich](http://github.com/dmitry-ilyashevich).

    * **[Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/phuibonhoa/handcrafted-haml-textmate-bundle)** by [Adam Stacoviak](http://www.adamstacoviak.com) and adapted by [Philippe Huibonhoa](http://github.com/phuibonhoa). It's available via the [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) plugin as well.

    * **[Atom](https://github.com/HarlemSquirrel/language-haml)** by [Kevin McCormack](https://github.com/HarlemSquirrel).
