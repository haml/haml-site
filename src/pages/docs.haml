    ## Tutorial

    [The tutorial](/tutorial.html) is a great place to start if you aren't familiar with the language. It goes over the basic syntax for elements, as well as how to embed Ruby in the document.

    ## Haml Reference

    [The Haml reference](/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html) is the most complete documentation for Haml. It contains information on every language feature, all the [options](/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html#options), and how to [install it as a Rails plugin](/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html#plugin).

    ## FAQ

    If you're having trouble or have a question, try [the FAQs](/docs/yardoc/file.FAQ.html). If you don't find what you're looking for there, ask [the Haml community](/help.html).

    ## API Documentation

    Finally, if you want to look at the Haml implementation, check out the [YARD](http://yardoc.org) [API Documentation](/docs/yardoc/). This probably won't be too useful for most people, but if you're writing Ruby code to interact with Haml, it's a good place to look.
